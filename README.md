# Treasure Hunt Game - API and Frontend

This project is a **Treasure Hunt Game** that includes both a **backend API** and a **frontend React application**. The game involves solving clues, and the backend API manages game sessions and clues, while the frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the game.

## üïπÔ∏è Description

The Treasure Hunt Game consists of two main parts:

### **Backend (Node.js/Express)**:
- Manages game sessions using `sessionId`.
- Provides API endpoints to fetch available games, start a new game, retrieve clues, and check answers.
- Stores game progress in memory (for simplicity; a database is recommended for production).

### **Frontend (React)**:
- Provides a game selection page to choose a game.
- Displays clues and allows users to submit answers.
- Manages game state using React's state management.
- Communicates with the backend API to fetch games, start sessions, retrieve clues, and check answers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

### **Backend:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

### **Frontend:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## üöÄ Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-backend-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install express cors
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   node <your-server-file-name>.js
   ```
   (Replace `<your-server-file-name>.js` with the actual name of your server file.)

   The server will start and listen on port 3000 (or the port specified in `process.env.PORT`).

4. **Update API URLs (if needed):**
   Ensure that the backend server is running on the correct URL. If you‚Äôre running it on a different port, update the API URLs in the frontend accordingly. The frontend assumes that the backend server is running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-frontend-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will launch in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Configuration

#### **Backend URL Configuration:**
In your frontend, ensure that the API URLs point to the correct backend server. For example:

```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api'; // Adjust if using a different port
```

Update the frontend API calls to match the backend structure, such as:

```javascript
fetch(`${API_URL}/games`);
fetch(`${API_URL}/game/start/:type`);
fetch(`${API_URL}/game/clue/:sessionId`);
fetch(`${API_URL}/game/answer/:sessionId`);
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Game Selection:
1. Open the frontend application in your browser.
2. You will see a list of available games.
3. Click on a game to start it.

### Clue/Answer Page:
1. After selecting a game, you will be redirected to the clue/answer page.
2. The first clue will be displayed.
3. Enter your answer in the input field and click "Submit."
4. If your answer is correct, the next clue will be displayed.
5. If your answer is incorrect, an error message will be shown, and you can try again.
6. Continue answering clues until you complete the game.

### Game Completion:
- When you complete the game, a completion message will be displayed.
- You can then return to the game selection page to play another game.

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### **Backend (Node.js/Express)**:

- **GET /api/games**: Fetches a list of available games.
- **POST /api/game/start/:type**: Starts a new game session and returns a `sessionId`.
- **GET /api/game/clue/:sessionId**: Retrieves the next clue for the session.
- **POST /api/game/answer/:sessionId**: Checks the answer and provides the next clue if correct.

## üîß Frontend Components

### **React**:

- **GameSelectionPage**: Displays the list of available games and handles game selection.
- **ClueAnswerPage**: Displays clues, handles answer submission, and manages game progress.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This setup uses **in-memory data storage** for user progress in the backend. For a production environment, consider using a **database**.
- The frontend communicates with the backend API using **HTTP requests**.
- The `sessionId` is used to track the game progress. The frontend stores it and sends it with each request to the backend.
- Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.
- The frontend assumes that the backend server is running on `http://localhost:5000`. If you are running the backend on a different port, update the API URLs in the frontend code.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- **User authentication** to personalize game sessions.
- **Persistent game progress** using a database.
- **Improved UI/UX** for a more engaging experience.
