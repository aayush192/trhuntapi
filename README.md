# Treasure Hunt API üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüó∫Ô∏è

The Treasure Hunt API is a fun backend service that allows users to play a treasure hunt game with different difficulty levels. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced clue solver, this API has something for everyone. The game provides clues in a JSON format, making it easy to integrate into your own projects or apps.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Three difficulty levels**:
  - **10 Clue Game** (Basic)
  - **20 Clue Game** (Intermediate)
  - **30 Clue Game** (Advanced)

- Each game contains a series of clues, each with an answer.
- The API exposes endpoints to fetch clues based on the game type (10, 20, or 30 clues).
- The backend handles all the game logic and clue delivery.

## Installation Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with the Treasure Hunt API, follow these installation steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)  
  You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **NPM** or **Yarn** (Node package managers)  

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/treasure-hunt-api.git

### Step 3: Set Up the Server
